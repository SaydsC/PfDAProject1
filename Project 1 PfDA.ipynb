This is inline with some of the data sets I work with in my current career. Employee attrition is something that has been on the rise with companies now looking how they can retain colleagues. In line with GDPR I am using a data set I took from Kaggle and have amended this to reflect data more in line with what I see.[https://www.kaggle.com/datasets?search=employee&sort=votes]\n",

    "We have a dataset with 22 variables over 1000 rows. The benefit of doing the histogram is that it allows us to visually view the data and take some high levels notes on specific variables. From the four histograms above we can quickly see that in the workforce we have:\n",
    "- attrition level of circa 18%\n",
    "- the frequency distribution of the age of the workforce with majority aged from mid twenties to mid forties\n",
    "- the male to female ratio is circa 42:58\n",
    "- majority of colleagues have worked for the company for ten years or less\n",
    "\n",
    "Very easily we have gained some very interesting insights but there are also disadvantages to solely relying on a histogram to answer our questions. Often we need to compare more than one variable at a time to get a full understanding. e.g. of the 18% of leavers we need to understand more about them if we want to address attrition and return it to an acceptable industry standard of between 6-8%.

Scatter plots allow us to see the relationship amongst variables and how perhaps they correlate with each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "From the scatterplot below we have gained some further insights. We can assume attrition after 30 years service is related to retirment. But interestingly it is equally spread out over the first 20 years of service with the exception of year 12. This tells us colleagues are more likely to  move early in their career both as they start out but also as they get established and more experienced. But we need to look at more variables."
